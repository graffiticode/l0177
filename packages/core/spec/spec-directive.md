You are given the source of a Learnosity **Author API** integration design (an `author-embed` program — a view function plus a chain of property functions) in this dialect, plus the dialect's canonical knowledge above. Produce a **developer integration RECIPE**: a precise, host-language-NEUTRAL procedure the caller implements in their own stack (Node, PHP, Ruby, .NET, …) to embed the described authoring experience.

This file states OUTPUT RULES. The FACTS — verified mechanisms, error codes, DOM anchors, traps — are in the canonical knowledge above; draw on them, do not wait for them to be repeated here.

Output these sections, in this order, as Markdown.

## Goal
One or two sentences: the authoring experience the developer will have working when done, specialized to the view and the design's specifics (mode, domain, user, reference, editor options, item bank).

- State only what the procedure achieves. **"Verified mechanism" means the MECHANISM works, never that THIS deployment has it in force** — a key can still be dropped, misplaced, or ignored under fail-open. Never write anything that reads as permission to skip a differential ("may be treated as fact once configured correctly").
- A `question-type-groups` restriction and the widget `edit`/`delete` permissions are verified mechanisms and may be stated as intent the verification confirms. An `allow-widgets` list of question TYPES is not enforceable at all — phrase it as intent pending observation.
- **If the design sets a key that can do nothing in the chosen view, say so here and recommend removing it** — name it inert, say which view it would apply in. Declining to test it is not enough; the reader would ship configuration they cannot justify.

## Blocking preconditions
Short, and first. ONLY what makes the whole task impossible if false — typically that the referenced item/activity exists and that the consumer can read the named organisation — each with its one-line check. Emphasis must match consequence: the fact that can end the task cannot sit where it is skimmed past.

## Preconditions
Consumer key + secret (secret **server-only**, never sent to the browser); the official server-side SDK; the serving domain; a stable author user id; the target element; and any **host-page obligations** the design implies (a real fixed footer for `fixed-footer-height`, an existing element for `scroll-into-view-selector`).

**Never write "no holes, nothing left to do."** A design with every required property present is COMPLETE AS A DESIGN and can still be operationally blocked. Give two statements: "the design is complete — no properties left to supply", then "still unverified before this can work: …" listing every precondition the integration cannot check for itself. If the design does have unfilled holes, state them as "you must still provide: …".

## Procedure
Numbered steps. SURGICALLY PRECISE where correctness is binary — `security` fields, the `YYYYMMDD-HHMM` UTC timestamp, the exact `mode` string, `domain` equal to the serving host, the BARE library host. ABSTRACT where it is the developer's choice (framework, HTTP, templating). Sign with the official SDK; never hand-roll. Describe only this construct's mode; note there is no in-UI view switching.

Three details are binary and have all been got wrong in practice — state them exactly:
- **Pass the SDK's return value through untouched.** `init("author", security, secret, request)` RETURNS the complete `{ security, request: { … } }`, options nested under `request`. Learnosity's docs list `mode`/`reference`/`user` as "initialization options", which reads as flat and is the natural wrong guess; assembling a flat object fails at init. Also: `organisation_id` is an **integer**, `mode` is the exact view string.
- **`LearnosityAuthor.init(initializationOptions, domSelector, callbacks)`**, or the two-argument `init(initObject, callbacks)`. **NEVER `init(initObject, callbacks, "<element>")`** — callbacks land in the selector slot, no listener registers, silent blank editor.
- **`request.user` is an OBJECT**: `user: { id: "…" }`, plus `firstname`/`lastname`/`email` when the design carries them. A bare `user_id` string fails init.

## Gotchas
The mistakes that cause silent failures or 401s for THIS experience: domain mismatch, secret leaking to the browser, timestamp skew, missing `errorListener`, an omitted or wrong `reference`. Always include:
- **The Author API fails open on `config`** — an unrecognized key is silently ignored while the editor initializes, `readyListener` fires, and the page looks correct enforcing nothing.
- **A versioned script URL 404s** — `LearnosityAuthor` undefined, `init()` never runs, NEITHER callback fires.
- **A `41003` does not always mean the domain is wrong** — it is also what a re-serialized or reordered request produces. Check serialization before re-checking a domain that is already correct.

## Verification steps
A runnable acceptance checklist against THEIR implementation. **Output a NUMBERED Markdown list — one check per line, each a single concrete pass/fail assertion.** Never a paragraph. Include at least one negative check. At minimum:

1. `readyListener` fires and the editor renders. State that this proves INIT ONLY — ready and error are not exclusive outcomes, and a content-load failure arrives AFTER ready. Never present it as evidence the editor works.
2. The requested item/activity loads and its content is visible, with nothing logged after ready. Phrase it as "confirm the named item exists in that bank and its content renders" — a `reference` that is present but names nothing fails identically to an absent one.
3. A signature tampered **inside the body, after the `$02$` prefix** triggers `errorListener` with **41003** during init. Corrupting the prefix instead yields 41001, also 401-class — so "flip a character and confirm a 401" passes without exercising the signing path.
4. The init payload delivered to the browser contains no consumer secret.
5. The `domain` in `security` equals the host serving the page.

Then add checks specific to the design, under these rules:

- **Every check on config-driven behaviour must be DIFFERENTIAL** — against a control init with the key omitted — and must state what each outcome means. Because the API fails open, observing the desired behaviour proves nothing on its own. This applies to ENABLING keys too (`edit: true` passes a bare "confirm editing works" even when the key was dropped), to list overrides (`question_type_groups`), and to `organisation_id`. Shape: *"Load twice — once as configured, once with the key omitted. If X differs, the path is live; if both runs look identical, the key changed nothing."* Say what a control-only result establishes: against a demo consumer it demonstrates the mechanism, never the caller's own value.
- **A key set to its own DEFAULT cannot be checked this way — replace the step, do not caveat it.** The control is identical by construction, so the comparison is *structurally uninformative* and reporting it as a pass or as evidence of a broken path are both wrong. Replace with: load once at the NON-default value, once omitted; the affordance must differ. Applies to every defaulted key, e.g. `shared_passage`, `settings.show`, and `widget_templates` `back`/`save`/`require_validation`.
- **A step that cannot fail is not a check — and neither is one that cannot pass.** Before emitting a step, ask what a failing AND a passing run look like IN THIS MOUNT: does the affordance exist in this view at all, and is the state reachable without vandalising something? If not, redesign or drop it. A checklist whose steps cannot produce evidence manufactures confidence, which is what this dialect exists to prevent.
- **Say which interactions WRITE, and send them at a scratch item.** Driving the editor can persist to the item bank — exercising a save path, deleting a widget. Name what a step can persist and direct the reader to a throwaway item or a duplicate; the design's `reference` is what is being verified, not what to experiment on. A step that mutates state is more dangerous than one that hangs a script and must be marked at least as loudly.
- **Name the observable anchor** for anything visible (the canonical knowledge gives them) and say what its absence means. "Open the picker and confirm the groups" without a selector is unactionable, and a loose one produces false passes against empty-state chrome.
- **Name a precondition that makes a check meaningful** when one exists — several keys are inert unless something else is true.
- **Diagnosis without a mechanism is half a step.** When a precondition cannot be checked from inside the Author API, name what answers it (item existence: the Data API `itembank/items`, a separate signed request, a one-off — not part of the integration).
- **Mark manual-only** any check that cannot run unattended, such as one gated on a native browser modal.

## Rules throughout

- **Config paths come from the `<COMPILED_PATHS>` block and the recipe must REPRODUCE that map.** Copy verbatim into the config the developer writes. Never derive a path from a key name — the flattening is ambiguous (`title-show` → `title.show`, but `enable-selection` → `enable_selection`) and under fail-open a wrong path looks configured and is not. A key absent from that map was rejected by the compiler: leave it out entirely.
- **Question-type values**: the EXACT lowercase Learnosity strings (`mcq`, `clozetext`) — never the UPPERCASE DSL tags, never underscore forms.
- **Restriction operates on GROUPS.** Emit the full override — all ten default group references, `template_references` omitted on those kept and `[]` on those removed — and explain WHY all ten appear: an unrecognised group reference is ADDITIVE, so supplying only the wanted groups restricts nothing.
- **Question TYPES are a different taxonomy and are NOT restrictable.** Name the intended types, state that enforcement is group-granular only, and carry the per-type expectation as a verification step. Never invent a per-type config key.
- **Never emit** `init_options.widgetTypes` or `config.widget_templates.widget_types` (neither restricts anything), or `config.widget_templates.edit`/`.delete` (supported by nothing).
- **Error events carry `code` and `message`, not `name`.** Direct the reader to log those and to label WHICH PHASE the error arrived in — init, or after ready — which is what makes a post-ready failure legible.
- **Label stack-specific hazards with the stack**, e.g. `[Python/Flask]`, so a reader on another stack skips them at a glance. State the neutral invariant unlabelled (the signature covers the serialized request: do not re-serialize, preserve key order end to end) and label only the stack-specific ways to violate it.
- Describe the procedure for the SPECIFIC view and properties present; do not cover views the design did not ask for.
- Do NOT emit runnable host-language code — describe the steps; the caller writes the code.
- Do NOT mention Graffiticode, this dialect, node tags, "the record", or that you are reading source.
- Output only the recipe. No preamble, no surrounding code fences.
